The data covers the period from January 2014 to December 2017 with fields such as date, country, product ID, shop, gender, size, unit price, discount, year, month, and sale price.  \n",

        "**`Methods`** \n",
        "The dataset contains information on six years of Canadian shoe sales analyzed to identify trends and patterns to forecast inventory. An inferential analysis, or statisticsl technique of a population based on sample sales data, provides a confidence level in the recommendations made. The resulting sales variance is significant indicating a greater level of uncertainty in the predictions made.  \n",

        "Confidence intervals assessed store inventory numbers by 12 show sizes. Confidence intervals help to provide a range of values within which I can be confident that the true population parameter lies. I calculated the confidence intervals within a population with a known variance to identify the appropriate inventory numbers for the following year.  \n",

There are essentially three steps to this process for which your Notebook's Bibliographic support can assist: gathering and organizing sources you intend to use, citing those sources within the text you are writing, and compiling all of the material you referenced in an organized, correctly formatted list, the kind which usually appears at the end of a paper in a section titled \"References,\" \"Bibliography,\" or \"Works Cited. \n",
